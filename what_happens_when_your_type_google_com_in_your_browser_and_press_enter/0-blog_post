What happens when you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter?

1. - 2. [DNS - Domain Name System]
The very first step when we press Enter is to translate the domain name into an IP address.
It first checks if the corresponding IP address is present in its cache.
If the browser does not have a response, it will send a request to the DNS to find the IP address.

3. [TCP/IP]
Once the IP address is obtained, the browser opens a connection with the web server.

4. [Firewall]
During transmission, the request crosses several firewalls.
This allows to filter requests and unblock any malicious traffic.

5. [SSL/TLS]
When we use an "https", the browser requests an SSL certificate from the server.
A secure connection is then used between the client and the server, in order to encrypt the transmitted data.

6. [Load Balancer]
This helps balance the server load, by redirecting requests to the least loaded server.

7. [Web Server]
The web server processes the request and determines which files to return to the client.
This can be HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.

8. [Application Server]
If the request requires dynamic data, the web server sends the request to the application server which will process the data and perform the necessary logic.
This can be a database server, a file server, etc.

9. [Database]
If the request requires data stored in a database, the database server will process the request and return the data to the application server.

10. [Response]
The web server sends the response back to the client, which displays the web page on the browser.
